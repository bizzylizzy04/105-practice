			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app, you're going something you've never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, &amp; in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you're heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you've engaged in the problem solving pursuit that's math & technology &amp; that it's time for you to dig deeper &amp; keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you're learning a new technology, whether you're learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you're looking at is doing this THING, but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, &amp; in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see, when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
